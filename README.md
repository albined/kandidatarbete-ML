## Installation
Clone the project and install the requirements to your environment:

`git clone https://github.com/albined/kandidatarbete-ML.git`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run **main.py** to start the program

## Usage

### Neural network image classification
- Select the test you want to perform in the checkbox
- Edit the input fields to select which values you want to evaluate
  - The inputs should be given as a list of integers separated by commas
- Click on _**Train and Test**_ to train a neural network with the selected values. A plot will show up once the process is 
complete. Tables with the results can also be found in `/pca_image_classification/results`
- _**Only test**_ will only retest the models and will not repeform the training stage

### PCA image classification
- select the desired training set sizes and score matrix sizes for the test
- click on _**Test**_ to run the test. 
  - the Training set size can at a maximum be 60000
  - -1, -2 and -3 correspond to the reduced training set sizes 0.5, 0.75 and 1 respectively

### SVD image compression
- Enter the number of singular values to keep after compressing in the input field
- Import the image you want to compress with the _**Import**_ button
- Click on _**Run**_ to perform the test
  - The output will be shown in the second image box once it's been computed
